    <h1>Driving Personality Quiz</h1>
    <img src="Screenshot 2024-11-06 at 11.34.37.png" alt="Personality Quiz">
    <p>This project was inspired by the purchase of my first car back in September.</p>
    <p>I love to drive and couldn't wait until I was old enough to get my permit. My family says I'm an aggressive driver, which is far from true.</p>
    <p>I made this quiz to test that accusation and through the use of "If statements" each input creates an output generating what type of driver you are. </p>
